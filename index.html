            <h2>summary and objective</h2>
            <p>Since honorable discharge from the U.S. Army Engineer Corps in 2014, has survived working freelance and contract between carpentry and programming. He spent half his G.I.Bill on behavioral health and the other on computer science, and although he has no degree, he puts these people and process improvement skills to good use everywhere he goes. He is flexible, adaptable, and knows how to learn. Currently he is splitting his time between technical consultant/engineer for a startup building automated data driven mushroom grow tanks, and working on a farm to pay the bills. His objective is to find a commit to a steady full time tech-related job locally which justifies additional related study time.</p>
